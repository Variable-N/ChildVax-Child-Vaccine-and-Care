<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][screenshot1]
![Product Name Screen Shot][screenshot2]

On-time vaccination throughout childhood is essential because it helps provide immunity before children are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. But there is no easy to use software to keep track on your childs vaccination. In this CSE470 project, I am proposing a system where you can find your child's full vaccination roadmap and extra care such as Doctors appointment and etc.

Goal: Ensuring a smart way to track the vaccination of a newbourn baby and emergency care if required.

Why do we need ChildVax:
* Vaccine card or old ways can not be trusted as the vaccine requirement is updating.
* Vaccination is a long process. For example, Meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY)(2nd dose)  given at 16 years old. So, a all in one website is more handy.
* A easy to use doctor appointment system specifically designed for parents.
